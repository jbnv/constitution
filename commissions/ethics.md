# Commission on Ethics and Compensation

SECTION 1. The commission may recommend the salary of the members of the Legislature and may recommend that the salary of the speaker of the Legislature and the lieutenant governor be set at an amount higher than that of other members.  The commission shall set the per diem of members of the Legislature and the lieutenant governor, and the per diem shall reflect reasonable estimates of costs and may be raised or lowered biennially as necessary to pay those costs, but the per diem may not exceed during a calendar year the amount allowed as of January 1 of that year for federal income tax purposes as a deduction for living expenses incurred in a legislative day by a state legislator in connection with the legislator's business as a legislator, disregarding any exception in federal law for legislators residing near the Capitol.

SECTION 2.  At each general election for state and county officers following a proposed change in salary, the voters shall approve or disapprove the salary recommended by the commission if the commission recommends a change in salary.  If the voters disapprove the salary, the salary continues at the amount paid immediately before disapproval until another amount is recommended by the commission and approved by the voters.  If the voters approve the salary, the approved salary takes effect January 1 of the next odd-numbered year.
