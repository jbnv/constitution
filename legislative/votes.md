## Votes

(a) A vote taken by the Legislature must be by record vote with the vote of each member entered in the Journal of Proceedings if the vote is on final passage of a bill, a resolution proposing or ratifying a constitutional amendment, or another resolution other than a resolution of a purely ceremonial or honorary nature.  The Legislature by rule may provide for exceptions to this requirement for a bill that applies only to one district or political subdivision of this state.  For purposes of this subsection, a vote on final passage includes a vote on third reading, or on second reading if the house suspends the requirement for three readings, on whether to concur in the other house's amendments, and on whether to adopt a conference committee report.

(b)  The yeas and nays of the members of the Legislature on any other question shall, at the desire of any three members present, be entered on the journal of proceedings.

(c)  The Legislature shall submit each record vote required under Subsection (c) of this section, including the vote of each individual member, to the Legislative Archive.  For a record vote on a bill or on a resolution proposing or ratifying a constitutional amendment, the record vote must be accessible to the public by reference to the designated number of the bill or resolution and by reference to its subject.
