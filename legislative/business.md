## Meetings and Order of Business of the Legislature

SECTION 1. REGULAR SESSION. The Legislature shall meet every two years at such time as may be provided by law and at other times when convened by the Governor.

(a)  When convened in regular Session, the first thirty days thereof shall be devoted to the introduction of bills and resolutions, acting upon emergency appropriations, passing upon the confirmation of the recess appointees of the Governor and such emergency matters as may be submitted by the Governor in special messages to the Legislature.  During the succeeding thirty days of the regular session of the Legislature the various committees of the Legislature shall hold hearings to consider all bills and resolutions and other matters then pending; and such emergency matters as may be submitted by the Governor.  During the remainder of the session the Legislature shall act upon such bills and resolutions as may be then pending and upon such emergency matters as may be submitted by the Governor in special messages to the Legislature.

(b)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the Legislature may determine its order of business by an affirmative vote of four-fifths of its membership. 

SECTION 2. SPEAKER; OTHER OFFICERS. The Legislature shall, when it first assembles, organize temporarily, and thereupon proceed to the election of a Speaker from its own members.

SECTION 3. (a) The Speaker of the Legislature shall have the option to perform the duties of the Lieutenant Governor in any case of absence or temporary disability of that officer. The Legislature shall choose its other officers.

(b) If the office of Lieutenant Governor becomes vacant, the Speaker of the Legislature shall convene the Committee of the Whole Legislature within 30 days after the vacancy occurs.  The Committee of the Whole shall elect one of its members to perform the duties of the Lieutenant Governor in addition to the member's duties as Representative until the next general election.  If the Representative so elected ceases to be a Representative before the election of a new Lieutenant Governor, another Representative shall be elected in the same manner to perform the duties of the Lieutenant Governor until the next general election.  Until the Committee of the Whole elects one of its members for this purpose, the President pro tempore shall perform the duties of the Lieutenant Governor as provided by this subsection.

SECTION 4.  QUORUM; ADJOURNMENTS FROM DAY TO DAY; COMPELLING ATTENDANCE.  Two-thirds of the Legislature shall constitute a quorum to do business, but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day, and compel the attendance of absent members, in such manner and under such penalties as the Legislature may provide.

SECTION 5.  RULES OF PROCEDURE; PUNISHMENT OR EXPULSION OF MEMBER.  The Legislature may determine the rules of its own proceedings, punish members for disorderly conduct, and, with the consent of two-thirds, expel a member, but not a second time for the same offense.
