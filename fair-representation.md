# Fair Representation

(a) The state shall ensure fair representation of all parishes, municipalities and persons within the state in the legislative and executive proceedings of the state, without regard to political affiliation, culture, ethnicity or any other quality inherent among the people represented.

(b) To ensure the guarantees enumerated in Section 2, districts shall be apportioned by distribution of population as determined by the national census, or a census authorized by the constitution and duly conducted. Apportionment shall respect parish boundaries as permitted by population distribution, and where it shall be necessary to apportion a district across parish boundaries to fulfill equal distribution of people, parishes of lower population shall take precedence over powers of greater population.
