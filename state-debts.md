## State Debts

(a) No debt shall be created by or on behalf of the State, except:

(1)  to supply casual deficiencies of revenue, not to exceed in the aggregate at any one time two hundred thousand dollars;

(2)  to repel invasion, suppress insurrection, or defend the State in war;

(3)  as otherwise authorized by this constitution; or

(4)  as authorized by Subsections (b) through (f) of this section.

(b)  The Legislature, by joint resolution approved by at least two-thirds of the members of the Legislature, may from time to time call an election and submit to the eligible voters of this State one or more propositions that, if approved by a majority of those voting on the question, authorize the Legislature to create State debt for the purposes and subject to the limitations stated in the applicable proposition.  Each election and proposition must conform to the requirements of Subsections (c) and (d) of this section.

(c)  The Legislature may call an election during any regular session of the Legislature or during any special session of the Legislature in which the subject of the election is designated in the governor's proclamation for that special session.  The election may be held on any date, and notice of the election shall be given for the period and in the manner required for amending this constitution.  The election shall be held in each county in the manner provided by law for other statewide elections.

(d)  A proposition must clearly describe the amount and purpose for which debt is to be created and must describe the source of payment for the debt.  Except as provided by law under Subsection (f) of this section, the amount of debt stated in the proposition may not be exceeded and may not be renewed after the debt has been created unless the right to exceed or renew is stated in the proposition.

(e)  The Legislature may enact all laws necessary or appropriate to implement the authority granted by a proposition that is approved as provided by Subsection (b) of this section.  A law enacted in anticipation of the election is valid if, by its terms, it is subject to the approval of the related proposition.

(f)  State debt that is created or issued as provided by Subsection (b) of this section may be refunded in the manner and amount and subject to the conditions provided by law.

(g)  State debt that is created or issued as provided by Subsections (b) through (f) of this section and that is approved by the attorney general in accordance with applicable law is incontestable for any reason.
