## Governance over Roads and Highways

SECTION 1. The State shall have jurisdiction over roads and highways that have been designated and inventoried by the State. The State shall also have jurisdiction over roads designed as "interstate" or "federal" highways by the government of the United States.

SECTION 2. DESIGNATED STATE ROUTES. (a) The State shall designate, enumerate and publish routes of navigation among the roads and highways within its jurisdiction. The State shall have the authority to assign numbers and names to these routes. In designating and naming or numbering these routes, the state assumes responsibility for maintaining the roads and highways therein, and ensuring the use of the routes as safe corridors for travel and transportation.

(b) To avoid confusion with routes designated by the United States, the State shall seek to avoid designating any new state route with a name or number that is also assigned to a separate federal route within the jurisdiction of the State. 

SECTION . INVENTORY. The State shall also compile an inventory of roads and highways within the state, for the purpose of working with parish and municipal governments to maintain the general function of the road system. The State may develop a convention for identifiying inventoried roads and highways that is separate for that used for identifying designated state routes.
