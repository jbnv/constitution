#Â Fair Representation

SECTION 1. The state shall ensure fair representation of all parishes, municipalities and persons within the state in the legislative and executive proceedings of the state, without regard to political affiliation, culture, ethnicity or any other quality inherent among the people represented.

SECTION 2. The members of any governing body of the state designated as representative in nature shall be apportioned among the several parishes, according to the number of population in each, as nearly as may be, on a ratio obtained by dividing the population of the State, as ascertained by the most recent United States census, or a census authorized by the constitution and duly conducted, by the number of members of which the body is composed.

SECTION 3. Whenever a single parish has sufficient population to be entitled to a representative or delegate, such parish shall be formed into a separate District.

SECTION 4. When two or more parishes are required to make up the ratio of representation, such parishes shall be contiguous to each other.

SECTION 5. When any one parish has more than sufficient population to be entitled to one or more representatives or delegates, such representatives or delegates shall be apportioned to such parish, and for any surplus of population it may be joined in a District with any other contiguous parish or parishes.

SECTION 6. At no time shall any District be formed through extraordinary measures across parish or municipality boundaries, unless all other measures to respect such boundaries have been exhausted.
